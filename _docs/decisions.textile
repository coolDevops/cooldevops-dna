h1. How we make decisions

One thing we agree on at coolDevOps is that we don't want any manager roles. At Crisp they have a nice decision model which is specific for larger or even only their organisation. Our decision model is simpler.

* *Own decision*. Decide on yourself without consulting anyone.
* *Team decision*. Facilitate a team decision (using consensus, with majority vote as fallback if we canâ€™t reach consensus).

In our case *Team* means the whole company. As we're very small this is not that hard to do.
