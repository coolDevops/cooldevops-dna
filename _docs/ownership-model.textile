h1. Ownership model

coolDevOps is an Estionan "e-company":https://e-estonia.com/component/e-business-register/ (comparable to an English limited company). This means there are shares and someone has to own them.

We have no strict rules yet. But for the moment we all agree that if we accept you to work for coolDevOps you will get ownership of the company. Meaning all people who we agree upon to join will be able to join as shareholder.

We're not in it for the financial gain. Money is needed to keep the lights on of coolDevops and you need money to support your basic needs and your lifestyle. This is for everyone different. 

You can read in our "economic model":economic-model.html that you can still make as much money as you want. The goal is not to make profit with coolDevops but you can still make as much as you want.

As more people join we will work on the details of this topic. So we will define better rules as we grow.
