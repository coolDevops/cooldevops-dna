h1. What is coolDevOps and why?

We cloned the Crisp DNA because we believe in their values. It's off course possible in the future we will deviate from their values. As we grow the core should remain the same.

*coolDevOps is a home for IT consultants who value:*
    
* *Community* - We like to hang out with people who share our values
* *Freedom* - We want to control our own time
* *Competence* - We want to continuously learn
* *Good citizenship* - Heart over wallet (money isn't the main thing in life)
* *Professionalism* - We genuinely care about solving our customers problems
    
We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).
