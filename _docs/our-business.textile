h1. Our business

Formally, coolDevOps doesn't really have a business area. We are consultants and people can do whatever they want. Nothing about our model is specific to any domain or industry.

In practice though, because of our history and the people who happen to work at Crisp, we've evolved two main business areas:

# *Software development*. Mostly on top of the Java VM. Mostly longer engagements and close to full-time.
# *Agile/Lean coaching and training*. Mostly shorter engagements or part-time.
