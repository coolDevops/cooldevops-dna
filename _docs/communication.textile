h1. Communication

Our *main internal communication channels* are:
* Weekly all hands meeting - Via google hangouts we tend to have a small weekly meeting to discuss whatever need to be discussed. Eg. new consultants, opportunities, counseling,....
* Team mailing list - a single mailing list with everyone on it. 
* "Board meetings":board.html every month.
* "Slack":http://www.slack.com for chattier stuff (previously Skype)

Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above forums.

Where we *store info*:
* Google Docs - we used it for almost everything now a days. 
* GitHub - a github organization account for shared code and, well, the coolDevOps DNA that you are reading right now.

How we *communicate with the outside world*:
* Our website - "cooldevops.com":http://www.crisp.se
* Our blog - "cooldevops.com/blog/":http://cooldevops.com/blog/
* A mailing list for our customers and course participants, we send information about upcoming courses about once or twice per quarter. 
* Twitter - our twitter handle is "@coolDevOps":https://twitter.com/coolDevOps/
* "Facebook":https://www.facebook.com/cooldevops
* ... but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal and informal channels - coolDevOppers tweeting, blogging, and talking to friends and customers. Together we have a huge network!
